# AM2320_Pi
A python script for running the AM2320 temperature and humidity sensor on a Raspberry Pi

This script owes a lot to the code by Joakim Lotseng√•rd (https://github.com/Gozem/am2320), mostly by trying to understand the way that they accessed the i2c bus and then writing my own code to access the device in an object-oriented way.

Better README to be done when it's not so late at night.
