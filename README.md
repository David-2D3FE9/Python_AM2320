This repo get values from AM2320 on I2C bus in Python3.

Various examples added goes from simple `print()` to `sqlite3` record beside with cpu temperature.  
My personnal purpose is to monitor an outdoor case with a rapsberry pi inside, in order to monitor temperature and a case of sealing failure  

I forked to solve a minor bug and add examples


The main library for AM2320 is forked from https://github.com/UnfinishedStuff/AM2320_Pi
