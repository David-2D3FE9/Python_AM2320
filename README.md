This repo get values from a AM2320 temperature and humidity sensor.  
It works on I2C bus with Python3

Various examples added goes from simple `print()` to `sqlite3` record beside with cpu temperature.  

My personnal purpose of this repo is to monitor an outdoor case with a rapsberry pi inside  

The main library for AM2320 and the simple exaple was forked from https://github.com/UnfinishedStuff/AM2320_Pi
